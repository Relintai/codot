Applied / backported patches / prs
==================================

Skeleton Editor
---------------

The engine contains TokageItLab's SkeletonEditor prs 3.2 version from the godot engine repository.

Original pr: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45699
3.2 version: https://github.com/TokageItLab/godot/commits/pose-edit-mode

In order to simplify merging upstream godot commits I decided to port the necessary engine side changes by hand, (hopefully) in a way which minimalizes merge conflicts later. The editor plugins themselves are available via an engine module (modules/skeleton_editor).
